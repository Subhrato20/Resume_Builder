This is a rare opportunity to build a product from scratch, own key technical decisions, and play a key role in shaping the future of a company tackling big problems.

Startup Mindset – Comfortable with ambiguity, resourceful, and adaptable.
Product-First Thinking – You prioritize solving users' problems.
MVP Builder – Ability to quickly turn ideas into working products.
Autonomous & Ownership-Driven – You have a bias toward action and drive projects forward with confidence and accountability.
Forward Thinking - Comfortable integrating AI/ML capabilities into products or leveraging automation and intelligent deployment strategies to improve efficiency.
Construction Tech Integration (Bonus) – Experience integrating with industry-standard construction platforms such as Autodesk (AutoCAD, Revit, Forge API), Procore, Bluebeam, or similar. Familiarity with REST APIs, SDKs, and automation tools for data exchange and workflow optimization.
